Save The Scran

    👉：The 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations

Overview

Save the scran is an app designed to reduce food wastage by allowing communities to come together digitally to share food items preventing avoidable food wastage. If you have a food item lying in your fridge that is approaching its expiry date and you are not planning on consuming it, you can list it in the community market where other people can view the item and message you to collect the food item reducing food wastage and carbon footprint.
Motivation

Around 1.3 billion tonnes of food produced globally is wasted each year. In Scotland, 1.35 million tonnes of food and drink wastages was estimated in 2013.Likewise, 600,000 tonnes of food and drink wastage was produced in 2014 out of which 60% was classed as avoidable. Approximately 20% of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated by food waste where, avoidable food wastage is accountable for 2.1% which is equivalent to 1.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Similarly, the financial cost for avoidable food waste is around £1.1 billion per year. Scotland has set a target to reduce the food wastage by 33% by 2025.

Save the scran as a project aims to aid the project by providing a way to reduce the food wastage. The app allows user to add food and information about the food such as expiry date into the virtual fridge by taking a picture. If the food is approaching expiry date, the user can choose to put the item onto community market where other users are able to view the item and message the user to arrange pickup. This way a food item can be shared amongst the community market which could reduce the avoidable food waste.
Target

Our solution will help households to prevent food waste by implementing two strategies. We will remind people about the food they have stored and when it will go out of date and by making it easy for people to give away food that they will not be able to use and would usually throw away. Our app will therefore focus on the prevention of food waste and redistribution of food.
